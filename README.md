### Why I made this?


I wanted to backup my screenshots, camera roll, music, whatsapp media etc to my local machine. Ofcourse there are adb configurable scripts available, But I wanted it to be wireless and also there are cloud backups available too like google drive. But it is quite slow as my internet speed is not so fast. I wanted to learn Golang :)

It is very fast and accessible for me and maybe others can find it useful too.
